## Road Structures
To validate the performance of AMACollision under diverse driving scenarios, we adopt three various road structures provided by the Town03 map of Carla, as detailed below:

Town 3 is a larger town with features of a downtown urban area. The map includes some interesting road network features such as a roundabout, T-Junction and Intersection.

- **T-Junction**

  A three-way intersection which requires precise maneuvering of the *AVUT* when merging or yielding, e.g., right-of-way conflicts.

- **Intersection** 

  A classic four-way crossroads without traffic signals, including multiple conflict points which tests the *AVUT*'s ability to coordinate with other agents.

- **Roundabout**

  This road introduces a circular segment, significantly increasing the complexity due to the need for continuous lane-following while managing entry, circulate and exit from the roundabout unpredictably.

## NPC Configurations

For all three road structures, we deploy three distinct NPC configurations to enhance the complexity and variability of testing conditions. Each NPC is assigned a unique starting position and destination. All starting positions and destinations of AVUT and NPCs are demonstrated on figures below. The red line represent the trajectory of the AVUT, others represent the trajectories of the NPCs. 

**NPC  Configuration 1:**  including two four-wheeled vehicles (2V). 

- **T-Junction**  

  NPC1 is going to take a left turn , and NPC2 is going to go straight and get through the junction.

- **Intersection**

  Similar to T-Junction, NPC1 is going to take a left turn , and NPC2 is going to go straight and get through the intersection.

- **Roundabout**

  NPC1 is going to driving along the round road, NPC2 is going to merging into the roundabout.

**NPC  Configuration 2:**  including two four-wheeled vehicles and one motorcycle (2V+1M). 
- **T-Junction**

  Add a motocycle (NPC3), which is going to turn right on the junction.

- **Intersection**

  Add a motocycle (NPC3), which is going to drive straight to get through the intersection.

- **Roundabout**

  Add a motocycle (NPC3), which is going to turn right and merge into the roundabout.

**NPC  Configuration 3:**  including two four-wheeled vehicles, one motorcycle, and one perdestrian (2V+1M+1P).  

- **T-Junction**

  Add a perdestrian(NPC4), which is going to walk straightly and get through the junction.

- **Intersection**

  Add a perdestrian(NPC4), which is going to walk straightly and get through the intersection.

- **Roundabout**

  Add a perdestrian(NPC4), which is going to walk straightly and get through the junction.

## Experiment Setup For Each RQ

- For **RQ1**, we select the second NPC configuration which includes two four-wheeled vehicles and one motorcycle(2V+1M). The speed limit for *AVUT*  is set to 5 m/s. We conduct experiments to compare the effectiveness of AMACollision with two baselines across all road structures.  

- For **RQ2**, we conduct comparative experiments using all three NPC configurations across each road structure. The speed limit for *AVUT*  is also set to 5 m/s. 


- For **RQ3**, we employ ten distinct speed limits for *AVUT*, ranging from 1 m/s to 10 m/s, in 1 m/s increments. The experiments for RQ3 are conducted on each speed limit, utilizing the second NPC configuration across all road structures. The *AVUT* is subjected to 500 testing episodes for each experiment.
